## Description 
For this weeks homework we were required to create a Random Password Generator using Javascript, the HTML was all provided. The main criteria to be submit were that the password was randomly generated with the help of Math.random. The webpage prompts the user on how long the user wants their password while having to stay within 8 to 128 characters. This was achieved with a For loop where the code loops the amount of times the user inputs. The user has the option to include Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric and Special Numbers and has to be checked to make sure atleast one option is chosen. If all Criteria is met, Javascript will then output the Password into the Text Area provided in the HTML Document.
